>**There is no guarantee that this project will ever get released due to the difficulty of the task and the scale of the dev team (Literally one single teenage boy who happens to love Stepmania and NotITG.). However, I will be happy to accept *any* additions, no matter how <sub>small</sub>.**

# **Project Arrow Storm**

Project Arrow Storm is a passion driven project that aims to create a hub for the Stepmania and ITG communities! It's also aims to solve a few problems between them.

## So, what's this about?

Well, glad you asked! ArrowStorm aims to create a place where it's easy to learn how to create charts, share them and download them! It's also adding a forums section and a skins section (both may not make it into this repo, due to requiring external servers, but who knows?)!

## Can I help with anything?

Feel free to! I'm operating on a basis of pull and commit, to prevent any unwanted changes, so be warned of that. If there's anything you want to implement, check the GOALS.txt file to see what is currently needed. If it's there, make an issue first and if it's not marked as resolved within 7 days, that's your go ahead! If what you want to add isn't in GOALS.txt, hit me up at kisanosano@proton.me.
